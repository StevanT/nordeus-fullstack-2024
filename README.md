# NordeusFullStackChallenge
 Project done for the 2024 Nordeus Full Stack Challenge

To play the game, unzip the fullstack.zip archive, and start "Arpixelago - NordeusFullStackChallenge 2024.exe".

There are three buttons on the main menu, and one checkbox.

The middle button will put you in a classic game of Arpixelago,
showing you a map and letting you guess the island with the tallest average height.
You have three tries.

The left button, showing a stopwatch, will put you in a timed game.
Instead of a set amount of tries, you have a timer ticking down. When the time runs out, you lose.
Each time you guess incorrectly, your timer loses a little bit of time.
Each time you guess correctly, the timer is reset, you gain 1 point, and a new map is spawned.

The right button, showing a graph, will direct you to the statistics screen.

The "offline" checkbox will enable you to play without an internet connection,
meaning all the maps will be randomly genrated.

Have fun! :D
